# ViNET

ViNET is an offline, real-time object detection and depth estimation iOS app designed to empower visually impaired users with instant, multi-modal feedback. By combining lightweight CoreML models with a minimalist interface, ViNET delivers object type, position, and precise distance information—via speech and haptic cues—without ever requiring a network connection.

## Key Features

* **Real-Time Object Detection**

  * Detects 80 object categories (e.g., pedestrian, vehicle, obstacle) entirely on-device with YOLOv8s.
* **Accurate Depth Estimation**

  * Estimates meter-level distances using MiDaS\_Small and CoreML optimizations.
* **Multi-Modal Feedback**

  * **Speech**: “A table is 75.4 centimeters to the right.”
* **Offline & Privacy-First**

  * No internet needed; all video frames and model weights stay on the user’s device
* **Battery-Friendly**

  * Maintains \~30 FPS preview while keeping CPU usage below 70%

**Note:** The SPMP, SRS, SDD, and STD documents were originally written in Turkish. I’ve added machine-translated versions (via DeepL) to this repo, so some diagrams remain in Turkish and certain abbreviations may be unclear in English. Full English revisions are coming soon.
